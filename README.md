# Motivation 
Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a systems engineering paradigm that promotes the systematic use of models throughout the engineering process. It has emerged as a promising approach for developing complex systems in a cost-effective and efficient manner. MBSE facilitates effective representation of the many different artifacts that are required during system development, from requirements elicitation and analysis, design, manufacturing, implementation, validation, and delivery to maintenance and evolution. Moreover, MBSE supports the implementation of many of the activities involved in development, from individual steps to entire processes and workflows. Compared to traditional (e.g., ’document’-based development), MBSE can thus improve communication and present analysis and automation opportunities that can help ensure that the system satisfies complex, possibly evolving sets of requirements from different stakeholders and make development more efficient and agile overall. MBSE also facilitates leveraging new and emerging data analytics techniques and tools through, e.g., detection of anomalies, monitoring of KPIs, as well as automatic simulation and ’what-if’ analyses.
SysML (Systems Modeling Language) is a modeling language that has been specifically designed to support Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE). It provides a standardized and unified approach to modeling system requirements, architecture, behavior, and performance and has become a de facto standard. It is a graphical (and soon textual) language that allows system engineers to represent complex systems and their interactions in a clear, consistent, and structured way.

By using SysML, MBSE practitioners can create high-quality models that enable effective system design, analysis, validation, and testing. SysML also facilitates the integration of various engineering disciplines and stakeholders throughout the system development lifecycle. This makes it easier to ensure that the
system meets the desired functionality, performance, reliability, and safety requirements. In addition, SysML is an essential tool for MBSE practitioners to
effectively represent and manage the diverse artifacts and processes involved in system development, resulting in more effective and efficient system development
processes.

# Objectives
The goal is to bring together researchers and practitioners, from both industry and academia, interested in MBSE and SysML.

# Intended audience
The intended audience consists of all people from industry or academia who are interested in the use of models or SysML for the engineering of systems in any domain.
