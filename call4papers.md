### Motivation

Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has emerged as a promising approach for developing complex systems in a cost-effective and efficient manner. It promotes the systematic use of models throughout the engineering process, facilitating effective representation of system artifacts and supporting various activities involved in development.

### Objective
The 1st Workshop on MBSE aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from industry and academia interested in the use of models and modeling for systems engineering. The workshop provides a platform to share experiences, best practices, and solutions, as well as discuss the latest advances, challenges, and future directions in MBSE and associated languages (e.g., SysML and Arcadia/Capella), techniques, and tools.

### Topics of Interest
We invite submissions related to the application of SysML in modeling systems and its impact on system development and engineering processes. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Best practices for implementing MBSE in different domains (e.g., aerospace, automotive, defense, etc.) 
  - Experience reports on the benefits and challenges of using MBSE in different domains
* Tooling and automation for MBSE
* Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) technologies
* Model-based systems engineering process improvement, including:
  - Data-driven optimization of simulated product development processes using machine learning and analytics 
  - Notations and languages for CI/CD process simulation and testing 
* MBSE for system validation and verification


### Submission Guidelines
Submissions must adhere to the IEEE formatting instructions, for which An Overleaf template is available here. Papers should have at least 5 pages, 5 pages for short papers and 10 pages for full papers following the same style and format as the main tracks of the Conference. Submit your workshop proposal electronically in PDF using the MODELS EasyChair submission site [our easychair link here?]. All submissions will undergo a peer-review process by the program committee. Submissions that do not adhere to the formatting instructions may be desk-rejected without review.

  - Tue 15 Aug 2023: Notification of authors
  - Tue 22 Aug 2023: Camera-ready deadline
  - Sun 1 Oct - Tue 3 Oct 2023: Workshop dates
