### Motivation

Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has emerged as a promising approach for developing complex systems in a cost-effective and efficient manner. It promotes the systematic use of models throughout the engineering process, facilitating effective representation of system artifacts and supporting various activities involved in development. SysML (Systems Modeling Language) has become a de facto standard for MBSE, providing a unified approach to modeling system requirements, architecture, behavior, and performance.

### Objective
The 1st Workshop on MBSE and SysML aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from industry and academia interested in the use of models and SysML for system engineering. The workshop provides a platform to share experiences, best practices, and solutions, as well as discuss the latest advances, challenges, and future directions in MBSE and SysML.

### Topics of Interest
We invite submissions related to the application of SysML in modeling systems and its impact on system development and engineering processes. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Best practices for implementing MBSE and SysML in different domains (e.g., aerospace, automotive, defense, etc.) 
  - Experience reports on the benefits and challenges of using MBSE and SysML in different domains
* Tooling and automation for MBSE and SysML
  - What are the tools available for MBSE and SysML, and how do they support the development process?
  - How can automation be used on SysML models to support MBSE, and what are the limitations of automation? 
* Machine learning, AI technologies and SysML
  - How can AI techniques be integrated with SysML to support decision making in system development and validation? 
  - How can SysML models be integrated with machine learning models to support system simulation and analysis? 
  - How can machine learning algorithms be used to automatically generate SysML models from natural language descriptions of system requirements for better understanding and visualizing system components?
* Model-based systems engineering process improvement using SysML
  - How can MBSE and SysML be integrated into the development process to improve efficiency and effectiveness? 
  - What are the best practices for managing and sharing MBSE models across the development team?
  - SysML models examples/experiments for product development processes modeling, design, and validation 
  - Data-driven optimization of simulated product development processes using machine learning and analytics 
  - MBSE for continuous improvement and evolution of development processes 
  - Domain-specific modeling languages for development processes 
  - Using MBSE to identify and prioritize system process improvements 
  - Notations and languages for CI/CD process simulation and testing 
* SysML and MBSE for system validation and verification
  - How can MBSE and SysML be used to support system validation and verification? What are the best practices for using MBSE and SysML in the context of system testing and validation?


### Submission Guidelines
Submissions must adhere to the IEEE formatting instructions, for which An Overleaf template is available here. Papers should have at least 5 pages, 5 pages for short papers and 10 pages for full papers following the same style and format as the main tracks of the Conference. Submit your workshop proposal electronically in PDF using the MODELS EasyChair submission site [our easychair link here?]. All submissions will undergo a peer-review process by the program committee. Submissions that do not adhere to the formatting instructions may be desk-rejected without review.


### Important Dates
  - Mo 17 July 2023: Submissions deadline
  - Tue 15 Aug 2023: Notification of authors
  - Tue 22 Aug 2023: Camera-ready deadline
  - Sun 1 Oct - Tue 3 Oct 2023: Workshop dates

We look forward to your submissions and participation in the 1st Workshop on MBSE and SysML, held in V채ster책s, Sweden!
